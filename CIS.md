# CIS Control 1: Inventory and Control of Enterprise Assets

   1.1: Establish and Maintain Detailed Enterprise Asset Inventory <control-1.1>
   1.2: Address Unauthorized Assets <control-1.2>
   1.3: Utilize an Active Discovery Tool <control-1.3>
   1.4: Use Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Logging to Update Enterprise Asset Inventory <control-1.4>
   1.5: Use a Passive Asset Discovery Tool <control-1.5>

**Why is this CIS Control Critical?**

Enterprises cannot defend what they do not know they have. Managed control of all enterprise assets also plays a critical role in security monitoring, incident response, system backup, and recovery. Enterprises should know what data is critical to them, and proper asset management will help identify those enterprise assets that hold or manage this critical data, so appropriate security controls can be applied. 

External attackers are continuously scanning the internet address space of target enterprises, premise-based or in the cloud, identifying possibly unprotected assets attached to enterprises' networks. Attackers can take advantage of new assets that are installed, yet not securely configured and patched. Internally, unidentified assets can also have weak security configurations that can make them vulnerable to web or email-based malware; and adversaries can leverage weak security configurations for traversing the network, once they are inside.

Additional assets that connect to the enterpriseâ€™s network (e.g., demonstration systems, temporary test systems, guest networks, etc.) should be identified and/or isolated, in order to prevent adversarial access from affecting the security of enterprise operations.
